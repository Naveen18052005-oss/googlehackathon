Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the combinational depth of a signal in an RTL design based on features like:

Fan-In

Fan-Out

Signal Type

Gate Count

Clock Frequency (MHz)

The project includes:

Synthetic dataset generation.

Data preprocessing (encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features).

Training an XGBoost regression model.

Evaluating the model using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R-squared.

Saving the trained model and preprocessing objects for future use.

Predicting combinational depth for new signals.

Features
Synthetic Dataset Generation: Generates a synthetic dataset for training and testing.

Data Preprocessing: Encodes categorical variables and scales numerical features.

XGBoost Model: Trains an XGBoost regression model to predict combinational depth.

Model Evaluation: Evaluates the model using MAE, MSE, and R-squared.

Model Saving: Saves the trained model and preprocessing objects for future use.

Prediction: Predicts combinational depth for new signals.

Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rtl-combinational-depth-predictor.git
cd rtl-combinational-depth-predictor
Install Dependencies:
Install the required Python libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost joblib
Run the Script:
Execute the Python script:

bash
Copy
python rtl_predictor.py
Usage
1. Training the Model
The script automatically generates a synthetic dataset, preprocesses the data, trains the model, and evaluates its performance. The trained model and preprocessing objects are saved to combinational_depth_predictor.pkl.

2. Making Predictions
To predict the combinational depth for a new signal, modify the new_signal dictionary in the script:

python
Copy
new_signal = {
    'Fan-In': 10,
    'Fan-Out': 4,
    'Signal Type': 'Control',  # This will be encoded
    'Gate Count': 20,
    'Clock Frequency (MHz)': 150
}
Run the script again to see the predicted combinational depth.
